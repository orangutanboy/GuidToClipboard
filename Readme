Generates a new GUID and copies it to the clipboard.

It accepts one command line argument which should be a single character; one of N, D, P, B or X. This determines the format of the GUID.
If no argument is supplied, the format is taken from the config app setting \"Format\". 
If this app setting does not exist, the default string format is used.
